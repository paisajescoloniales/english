# Collection
This curatorship of sources gathers different voices and visions of the changes that the Spanish conquest generated on indigenous societies and the landscapes of the Andes. You will be able to get closer to the Muisca goldsmithing and ceramics, explore different ways of representing the world on maps, read the complaints of the indigenous people about the damage that livestock did to their crops, compare the representations that the Europeans made of the indigenous people with the representations that the Muiscas made of themselves or read about the creation of colonial institutions through their administrative and legal documents.
