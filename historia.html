            Maldonado y Mendoza was born in Spain in 1551 and moved to Santafé de Bogotá in 1583. In 1586 he married Jerónima de Orrego, daughter and sole heiress of conquistador Alonso de Olalla.

            <p>
              That year, Maldonado y Mendoza began buying estates in the Bogotá Savanna and receiving lands awarded by the Spanish Crown. By the mid-1590s, Maldonado y Mendoza was not only the encomendero of the indigenous community of Bogotá, but owned one of the most prosperous cattle haciendas of the New Kingdom of Granada.

          <p>

    The crown attorney of the New Kingdom of Granada sued Maldonado y Mendoza in 1603, accusing him of having defrauded the monarchy by buying vast and fertile lands at a very low price. During litigation, both parts presented opposing understandings of the territory. While Maldonado described it as an unproductive marsh, the prosecutor considered it to be a fertile savanna. During the case, the map was meant to serve as proof to determine which part was right. For this purpose, imperial officers were ordered to explore the territory, see it with their own eyes, and draw it on paper so that it could be presented in court and help reach a decision. By sketching their observations on paper, the savanna became the subject matter of a court investigation within the legal framework of the monarchy.

          <p>
            The map features the Bogotá Savanna, a high plateau on the eastern mountain range of the northern Andes, in present-day Colombia. In the early sixteenth century, the Savanna was occupied by Muisca indigenous people, of the Chibcha linguistic family. A Spanish expedition led by Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada reached this place in 1536. From that moment onwards, the city of Bogotá became the base of operations of the Spanish Empire in the region, and in 1549 was designated as the seat of the Audiencia of Santafé.

          <h4 class="mas-title">A legal painting</h4>
          <p>
            While most legal maps were outlines of simple plans, this map is special not only for its use of color and elaborate designs, but because it is signed by its author, Juan de Aguilar Rendón, who identified himself as painter, and Alonzo Ruiz Gadálmez, as guarantor.
          </p>

          <p>
          The full title is <i>Painting of the lands, marshes and swamps of the town of Bogotá, made by order of the Real Audiencia of this city of Santafé of the New Kingdom of Granada, for the proceeding between the crown attorney and don Francisco Maldonado de Mendoza. By us, Alonso Ruiz Gadálmez, guarantor, and Juan de Aguilar Rendón, painter, in the month of April of the year 1614. </i>
          </p>
          <p>
            The acknowledgement of authorship is a rare occurrence both in the legal maps and the colonial paintings of New Granada. At the time, the concept of authorship itself had a very different meaning from the one we use today. The signature, the use of the term ‘painting’, and the use of color are indications that the author was also creating a piece that could be appreciated for its aesthetic qualities.
          </p>

          <p>
          Moreover, the signatures of the painter and guarantor ensured the validity of the land survey, and legitimized its use in court as a truthful representation of the territory.
          </p>

          <p>
      Although we do not know the origin of the paints used on the map, the production of inks and colors was a complex craft involving vegetable and animal pigments that were then transformed into paint through processes with rich cultural significance. We have evidence that the Muisca and other native groups used a wide palette of blue, red and brown pigments they applied to designs on textiles, rocks and other surfaces. For this reason, it is possible that some of the colors used in the <i>Painting</i> were native paints.
          </p>

          <p>
          Another visual aspect important for understanding the <i>Painting</i> is its scale. Unlike contemporary maps, which guarantee precision by maintaining a single scale throughout the image, the Painting uses a multiple, flexible and variable scale. The center of the map —which represents the territory disputed by Maldonado and the crown attorney— uses a more homogeneous scale, whereas the borders are variable, allowing the observer to see relatively remote landmarks like the city of Santafé and the towns of Fontibón and Madrid as points of reference.

"MAP, is what we call the board, canvas or paper in which universal or particular lands are depicted, it may come from mappa, which means canvas or fabric, particularly the ones Praetors in the circus would send as a signal so that the games would begin, which was whitened or treated with clay, or starched we may say, because the canvas on which the land, the sea and its parts were depicted was prepared in this way, it was called map, and mappa mundi, and for this reason we also call these depictions canvases, for being drawn on canvas".

          <p>
            Among the Kogi of the Sierra Nevada, the loom, in addition to being an instrument to spin their garments is a map that represents the human body and the geography of the Sierra:
          </p>

          <p>
    “When discussing the human body, the Kogi point out that parts of it can be identified with certain topographical features of the Sierra Nevada, and that these features are spatially distributed in such a way as to mark the outlines of a loom. A loom—any loom—thus becomes a map; the four corners of the square are the four Colombian cities that encompass the Sierra Nevada: Santa Marta in the northwest, Riohacha in the northeast, Fundación in the southwest, and Valledupar in the southeast. The center of the square, where the two poles form a cross, represents the snowpeaks. Once this overall framework has been recognized, it becomes easy enough to point out, in each of the four triangles, the rivers, mountains, villages, trails, or any other topographical feature.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
          In an anatomical interpretation of the loom, the five points where the wooden bars cross and are lashed together become the principal references: the cross on the upper left of the loom (from the point of view of the beholder standing in front of it) is the right shoulder (kukuba); the cross at the upper right is the left shoulder (seguika); the cross at the lower left becomes the right hip fmugaxa); and the one at the lower right becomes the left hip (nugaxalda). The point where the two poles intersect in the middle of the square is the heart (kuncama). A man’s torso, delimited by the shoulders and hips, is thus a loom. If one crosses one’s arms over the chest, with the outstretched fingers of the right hand touching the left shoulder and those of the left hand touching the right shoulder, one represents a loom”.

        The trial ratified the rights of Maldonado y Mendoza over his hacienda. In his will, Maldonado transformed his hacienda into a mayorazgo (entailed estate). This meant that following his death, it would not be divided between his heirs but would pass onto his oldest child, Antonio Maldonado de Mendoza.

            This was the birth of a powerful lineage that grew around the hacienda.
          </p>
          <p>
      This property was known as the “Meadow of Bogotá”, the <i>Mayorazgo</i> of Bogotá, or the Steer Yard, and was characterized by temporarily receiving cattle coming from the lowlands for its consumption in the city of Santafé de Bogotá. The heirs of Maldonado y Mendoza continued to merge with some of the most distinguished families in the New Kingdom of Granada, eventually receiving nobility titles and instituting themselves as the Marquisate of San Jorge.

          <h4 class="clave-title">Jorge Tadeo Lozano</h4>
          <p>
    Jorge Tadeo Lozano was born in Bogotá in 1771. He studied in Europe and became interested in natural history. This allowed him to join the Royal Botanical Expedition in Nueva Granada in 1803, as the person in charge of the zoological project. Given his high social and economic status, Lozano owned numerous haciendas in different climates, which made the task of collecting animals as part of his work easier. He would go on to write <i>The Fauna of Cundinamarca</i>. He also participated in the publication of <i>Correo curioso, erudito, económico y mercantil de la ciudad de Santa Fe de Bogotá</i>, one of the first enlightened journals of the republic. His work was part of the Spanish Crown’s wider search for ways of promoting the economy of the colonies through scientific expeditions, in the context of the Enlightenment and its global dynamics.
          </p>

          <p>
          As part of his administrative duties within the Spanish Empire, Lozano was named lieutenant protector of the Indians of Bosa, Fusagasugá and Usaquén in 1807. With the consolidation of the first government of the republic, Lozano served as the first president of the United Provinces of Nueva Granada, only to be deposed in 1811 in a coup d’état led by Antonio Nariño. After the Reconquista, the forces of Pablo Morillo shot Lozano on July 6th 1816, in what is now Plaza de Los Mártires, for his participation in republican politics.

          <p>
            This arbitrary category would be the basis for the classification of the inhabitants of the New World. In the sixteenth century, Spanish scholars and theologians debated intensely about whether the “Indians” were rational beings, like the Europeans, or inferior beings whose nature made their enslavement necessary. In this way, the great social complexity and ethnic diversity of the societies of the Americas was reduced to the term “Indian”, a negative and violent term that infantilized them and defined them as beings that needed to be trained to adopt European habits and ways of life.

            This process, which the Spanish called “reducing”, implied forcing indigenous people to abandon their living spaces and move to different settlements organized around a main square and drawn along a grid, following a Catholic order.

          <p>
          Many of the names of municipalities in use today used to be elaborate Muisca political categories. Terms like Ubaque, Guatavita, Bogotá and Duitama designated at once a political leader, a territory and a community. The colonial villages would keep the name of the native <button type="button" class="btn btn-clave" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#myModal2-2-3">cacicazgo</button> and its political structure, but inhabitants would be forced to live under a different spatial and cultural order.

          <p>
            The terms “cacique” and “cacicazgo” started being used by the Spanish in the Caribbean, after noticing that this was the word in Arawak used by natives to refer to their ethnic authorities. From then on, the Spanish used it as a generic term to refer to indigenous authorities throughout the empire. The Muisca term to designate some of these authorities was <i>psihipqua</i>. The caciques that led Muisca communities after the conquest had to change their form of governing in a colonial context in which natives were put under growing pressure. By the late sixteenth century we find many <i>caciques</i> dressing as Spaniards, using the title “don” and a European name (like Don Francisco de Ubaque), and financing murals, masses and Catholic celebrations.

          <h4 class="doc-title"> Don Francisco</h4>
          <h5 class="fuente-doc">
By the late sixteen century, the cacique of Ubaque called himself don Francisco. Don Francisco saw himself as a Christian man. He dressed with a blue suit and a cape, a hat with feathers and a sword hanging from his waist. As he himself declared, his weapon and horse were always ready to confront an Indian uprising. In his home, the decorations, tables and bed indicated he ate and slept like any Spanish gentleman. He enjoyed reading and writing, attending mass and living according to the values of the Catholic faith.
      </h5>

          <h5 class="fuente-doc">
For acquiring his European outfits, Don Francisco appeared often as a debtor with the merchants of Santafé, and tried to sell to his <i>encomendero</i> the best farming lands of his community in order to cover his debts. In 1583, Don Francisco appeared before the Real Audiencia of Santafé with a petition to change the succession practices of Muisca cacicazgos. Don Francisco wanted King Philip II to decree that nephews could no longer inherit cacicazgos (as was the norm following the criteria of matrilineal kinship prevalent in Muisca communities), but these would be inherited by sons (as was the case in Catholic societies). In his petition, Don Francisco complained of the idolatrous customs of his subjects and stated that these needed to be altered, a stance that led him to lose the support of his community.

          <h5 class="fuente-doc">
  “I am married… according to the order of the Holy Mother Church, to Doña Beatríz, my wife, and our marriage gave us a legitimate child and we live like the Spanish do, politically and in their clothing, preserving what Christians preserve both in the spiritual and the earthly, by way of example to all other Indians in this land” — Don Francisco.
          </h5>

          <h5 class="fuente-doc">
      Don Franciso “is a clever speaker of our Spanish language, of very good manner and reason, so much so that in this whole Kingdom… this witness does not know another cacique like this one… He is friends with the Spanish and when they visit his village and quarters he hosts them and prays, setting a table in the manner of the Spanish and providing them with a refined meal, as if he truly was Spanish” –Miguel de Espejo.

          <h5 class="fuente-doc">

        “He has tried to imitate the good manners of the Spanish with such effort, that his very subjects the Indians have been displeased by it saying that he does not practice the rites and ceremonies of the caciques of their ancestors”.

            On the map we can see where the “old palisade of the cacique” used to be. The Muisca of the Savanna had ceremonial centers that were known in the sixteenth century as “palisades”. These played an important role in their political organization.

          This territory had a long human history. About 12,400 years ago, in the late Pleistocene period, human groups dedicated to hunting, fishing and gathering fruit ascended the valley of the Magdalena River until they reached the high plateau of the Eastern Range of the Andes, and found refuge in its rock shelters. Between 5,000 and 7,000 years ago, they left their habitats to settle on open air lands.

          During the following millennia, they perfected the use of ceramics and developed denser farming communities. When the Spanish arrived, they were organized in farming societies with many levels of political hierarchy and its leaders lived in ceremonial places surrounded by logs of wood and decorated with paintings on cotton fabric of different colors and styles.

          <p>
            The creation of towns was part of a set of measures aimed at creating two separate “republics” with different legal responsibilities: one of Indians living in villages and one of Spaniards living in cities. This is why the “town of Bogotá” and the city of “Santa Fe” appear as different places on the map—the town of Bogotá in what is now Funza, and the city in the place of Santafé de Bogotá.

          <p>
      Although in theory the two republics were meant to remain spatially separated, this division was not applied so rigorously in practice. Indian villages continued to be places with vibrant economic activity around which orbited neighbors that did not identify as Indians.
          </p>

          <p>
            In fact, during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, many Indian villages had larger populations than that of cities like Santafé de Bogotá and Tunja. Likewise, Santafé de Bogotá held a large number of natives employed as merchants, selling goods and provisions on the main road and often registered as owners of building lots.

            Indigenous presence in the city was such that in 1594 the president of the Audiencia de Santafé, Antonio González, saw the need to create a new administrative position for a Spaniard in charge of supervising and controlling the activities of this group of people.</p>

          <p>
          The distinction between the town of Bogotá and the city of Santa Fe was maintained until the nineteenth century, when the republican government eliminated some Spanish names in an effort to create national symbols, thus erasing Santa Fe and leaving only Bogotá as the name of the city, while the old indigenous village took the name of Funza.

          <p>
      We tend to think of the European expansion as a human process, in which the Spanish, Portuguese, French and English crossed the Atlantic Ocean and established colonies in the Americas. Nevertheless, the process also implied the movement of plants, animals and pathogens between the Old and the New World. In this way, maize, chocolate, potatoes and tomatoes traveled from the New World to the Old, while cows, pigs, smallpox, wheat and sugar moved to the New World.
          </p>

          <p>
            This biological movement had a strong impact on native life. Smallpox, for example, detonated the demographic collapse of indigenous populations in proportions that are still hard for us to imagine. It is estimated that not until the early twentieth century did Colombia manage to regain its pre-Columbian population.

            Muisca indigenous people designed a system of ridges that produced elevated platforms used as cultivation terraces in this ecosystem rich in water sources. The terraces, in turn, were traversed by levees that drained excess water and served as fishing canals.

    On the painting, it is evident that the arrival of animals from the Old World had transformed the environments of the Andes. In fact, the painting shows us a landscape of cattle grazing lands, which already implies a transformation with respect to native landscapes. Nevertheless, we can still see the traces of the ridge system in aerial photographs of the 1950, which show a different way of inhabiting this environment.

          <p>
          These grasslands, nevertheless, did not adapt so easily to the hydrological dynamics of the eastern range of the Andes, and tended to flood. For this reason, some Spaniards describes these terrains as “useless” and “swampy”, as indicated in the map’s title. Nevertheless, by the early seventeenth century the Bogotá Savanna was already populated by a large number of sheep, chickens, cows, pigs and horses.

          <p>
            Yet the arrival of new plants and animals did not only have negative consequences. By the early seventeenth century, natives had incorporated eggs and chicken to their diet, and made their textiles with sheep’s wool. The new inhabitants were now interlaced into the landscapes of the Andes and the native and Spanish economies.

        The grasslands represented in the Painting are probably not the same that cover the Savanna today. In the eighteenth century, herders began importing African grass that produced better grazing lands for cattle, though it is possible that these types of grasses had begun to spread in the New World before that, as it was used to build the beds on ships used on the slave trade.</p>

          <h4 class="clave-title">Cattle Farming</h4>
          <p>
          Cattle farming is part of a long process of coexistence between humans and animals known as “domestication”. Although domestication was traditionally seen as a process in which humans dominated and tamed animals, recent research shows that this was not a process fully controlled by humans and that many animals started approaching and coexisting with human societies of their own accord. In Africa and Eurasia, cattle farming has been practiced for at least 6,000 years, and in Spain, all through Antiquity and the Middle Ages, a cattle culture took shape as part of a network of trade and connections with other parts of Europe, the Middle East and Asia. This form of cattle farming, centered on raising cows, sheep, goats and pigs, depended on the use of horses and dogs to control livestock that was allowed to roam freely.</p>

          <p>
        Native societies in the New World had domesticated many animals, among which dogs, turkeys and ducks, used for food and in rituals, and traded and given as tribute. In the Peruvian and Bolivian Andes, camelids were also raised, among which lamas and alpacas, used as pack animals and for their wool. These were the only animals to be raised in large herds. When cows, pigs and sheep were introduced into the New World, they quickly flourished and adapted easily to an environment lacking in natural predators. Along with these, came other unwanted species such as the Norway rat. Animal population grew so much that historian Elinor Melville has referred to the reproduction of ovine cattle in Mesoamerica as “the plague of sheep”.

The reform introduced a new legal figure that divided agricultural property in two categories: haciendas for Spanish dwellers and resguardos for natives. The 1559 reforms of Tomás López had created the villages in which natives would live under Catholic order, and now the resguardos dictated in which lands they were allowed to farm.

          <p>
          That same year, a position was created for a Spaniard in charge of distributing native labor, telling natives where to work, and regulating the way in which they managed their affairs.

          <h4 class="mas-title">The administrator of natives</h4>
          <p>
            The legal reform of 1593 also provided guidelines for managing native labor. For this purpose, a new position was created under the title of “corregidor de naturales” (administrator of natives). The alleged purpose of this position was to protect natives from being mistreated by their encomenderos.

          </p>

        <p>
            This is why Antonio González ordered that when a native confessed a felony to a priest, “the priest would secretly inform the corregidor, who in turn would punish the Indian according to the felony, negligence or crime, without exposing the priest as the source of the punishment, and in this way we will achieve what is most desired, that is, that natives love the priest and fear the corregidor”.
      </p>

          <p>
Ironically, the new administration did not give natives more autonomy. In fact, it gave the corregidor the power to submit natives to forced labor in haciendas and mines. This work was meant to be paid, but natives would not have complete autonomy in how they spent what they earned.
          </p>

          <p>
          On the contrary, the law specified that natives had to put their money in a “three-key chest,” a special type of coffer that could only be opened if three keys were used simultaneously. One of these keys was kept by the cacique, the other by the corregidor, and the third by the “doctrinero” priest (priest assigned to a native parish). In this way, they could ensure natives paid their taxes and tithes before they incurred in other expenditures.

      In 1594, a native authority from Pausaga expressed his inconformity towards the new demands regarding labor: “[Indians no longer pay taxes] so they can pay the salary and the food of the corregidor (…), who provides them no justice, and they would be better off saving what they pay the corregidor for the demora (period in which they worked in the mines) because they are too strained, and for paying the fifth part (of taxes) to Our Lord the King, and they also have to comply with their general labor commitments which give them great pains and many drown while crossing the rivers and others die while crossing the cold moors (páramos) and in Santa Fe they fall ill and many die due to the excessive work they are subjected to, and for trying to comply with these tasks, demoras and other fees they are forced to pay.”

Why is this a divided landscape?
</h5>
          <p>
        Resguardos were created at a time in which imperial administration defined Spaniards and natives as people with different economic capacities: Spaniards with extensive commercial lands and natives with restricted economies supervised by the imperial administration. Natives lost access to about 95% of the lands available to them for farming before the conquest.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this sense, this is a profoundly violent map. It is a map of land dispossession and of the transformation of native agricultural landscapes into grazing pastures for Spanish hacienda owners, in which natives were forced to work. The marks left by this process are revealed to us on the map by a few details, such as the place that marks the location of the former cacicazgo, or the small area allotted to the community’s resguardo, in contrast with the large haciendas of the Spanish.

          <p>
  Villages and resguardos have had a long and unstable trajectory since the sixteenth century, going through  waves of confrontation and resurgence. Most municipalities on the high plateau were former native villages. In the case of resguardos, after many attempts to dismantle them during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the Political Constitution of 1991 made it possible for them to become ethnic territories once again and since then, resguardos have offered new possibilities of ethnic autonomy.

          <h4 class="mas-title">Indian villages and reservations in the long run </h4>
          <p>
          Indian villages were axes of social life in the high plateau during the seventeenth century, providing services to everyone living outside cities. In fact, 94% of settlements were villages, while only 6% were cities or villas. The population that did not identify as indigenous —people of all walks of life grouped under the term “neighbors” or vecinos— grew progressively from the sixteenth to the seventeenth centuries, as indigenous population diminished (due to factors such as epidemics and the rigors of labor). Imperial authorities took different measures to deal with this demographic change. At first, they implemented the figure of <i>agregaciones</i> (aggregations), which consisted in unifying two or more native villages into a single settlement.

          <p>
          By the late eighteenth century, the people that identified themselves as “neighbors” and not as “Indians” had come to form a majority and Muisca was no longer the main language of communication. As a result, Viceroy Moreno y Escandón tried to dismantle the prevailing land regulation by transforming “Indian villages” into “parishes for the Spanish” and reducing the area of resguardos in order to allocate more lands to neighbors. Native communities did not accept this process in a passive way and, in fact, this was one of the main reasons why natives in the plateau would take part in the Revolt of the Comuneros.

            The independence movements of the nineteenth century tried to form a republic where there had been an Empire, and this implied remaking the political institutions. The new republic was based on the theoretical principle that all its inhabitants were “citizens” —free individuals with political rights— and, for this reason, all corporative and community entities, seen as inefficient and backward, had to be dismantled. “Indians” would no longer exist as a legal figure, nor would they be subject to special regulations —such as the one that under the Spanish Crown imposed on them higher taxes and labor demands, and assigned them to resguardos. To this end, the republican state repeatedly issued laws and decrees to end resguardos.

          <p>
            Natives answered to these laws in many different ways. In some cases, they made them work in their favor, and in others they opposed the dismantling of resguardos. Evidence shows these communal lands survived well into the 1940s, as did some social movements dedicated to ethnic revitalization and land restitution, such as the movement led by Manuel Quintín Lame to establish an Indian Council of the Indies that would advocate for indigenous interests.

          </p>

          <p>
          The tendency towards the dissolution of resguardos was reverted with the Political Constitution of 1991, which recognized Colombia as a multiethnic, multicultural nation and welcomed the existence of ethnic territories. From then on, processes of ethnic resurgence as well as demands for resguardo lands have flourished. On the Eastern Range, resguardos have been recognized in Cota, Suba and Guatavita, among many others.

      In an unexpected turn of events that unfolded over centuries, an institution designed by the Spanish Empire to expropriate native lands became one of the few paths for natives to access land, and a window to maintain ethnic autonomy.

          “Another matter that alters the idea of enumeration is the doubt I expressed to Your Excellence in a letter dated 22nd August in the town of Paipa, on whether the sons of a non-native father or mother are in fact free from paying tribute, considering that pure Indians are very rare, and it can be easily noted, with no further proof, that the species has degenerated; and so it is paramount that it be so, because there are hardly any Indian villages in which most people are not Spanish neighbors or people of color inhabiting the lands of resguardos or their surroundings. If they are to be free, there will be no villages or sources of tribute, or in any case earnings will be very narrow. In this regard, I think that Your Majesty is better off, and the government would benefit, if Indians were to become Spanish and in this way erase all memory of their tribute and the natural aversion that commands them. […]
<br />
  From these principles Your Excellence will gather the critical state of the population of the audited district and of the whole Real Audiencia: after the conquest, there were many Indian villages and few Spanish settlements, and despite the laws that prohibited it, they started intermixing with them and their children and descendants were mixed with white, mestizo, blacks and mulattoes, and their different propagations have formed the largest group of which the population is composed today. In this way, Indian villages were transformed into parishes of Spanish people, that is, of neighbors, who are not pure Indian, and separating them completely is so difficult that it is only ever applied to the ones causing express harm.”<br />
